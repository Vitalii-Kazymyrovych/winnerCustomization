# winnerCustomization

Spring Boot script that:

1. Reads ALPR detections from source PostgreSQL (`videoanalytics.alpr_detections` or configurable table).
2. Builds car movement sequences across configured camera stages.
3. Stores computed sequences in a separate PostgreSQL database.
4. Exposes XLSX report download endpoint.
5. Provides manual trigger endpoint to force source-table pull with anti-parallel and cooldown protection.

## Run

1. Build and run unit tests:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw -B test
   ```
2. Build jar:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw -B package
   ```
3. Put `config.json` near the jar (copy from `config.json.example` and fill values).
4. Start app:
   ```bash
   java -jar target/winnerCustomization-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```
5. Optional manual trigger (for external analytics callbacks):
   - `http://localhost:8080/source/trigger-pull`
   - returns `200` on success, `409` if a trigger is currently running, `429` during cooldown.
6. Download report from browser:
   - `http://localhost:8080/report/sequences.xlsx`

## Configuration

Use `config.json` (not committed) with:

- Source DB credentials: `host`, `port`, `db`, `schema`, `user`, `password`.
- Sequence DB credentials: `host`, `port`, `db`, `schema`, `user`, `password`.
- Source detections table name.
- Camera mapping list for:
  - Drive in (in)
  - Drive in (out)
  - Service-Drive in (in)
  - Service (in)
  - Service posts (array: post in/out)
  - Service (out)
  - Parking (in)
  - Parking (out)
- Direction ranges per camera (`from`/`to`) where null means no filtering.
- Alert timing thresholds.
- Telegram notifications toggle and credentials.

## Trigger endpoint behavior

- Endpoint: `GET /source/trigger-pull`.
- Performs immediate read from source detections table.
- Protection from duplicate/parallel calls:
  - only one running trigger at a time;
  - 30-second cooldown after successful trigger.
- Suitable for situations where multiple analytics systems can call the endpoint simultaneously.

## Startup troubleshooting

- If startup fails with `No qualifying bean of type 'com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper'`, ensure you are running a build that includes `JacksonConfig` (adds explicit `ObjectMapper` bean for runtime config loading).

## Notes

- Detailed console logging is enabled for runtime actions (config load, endpoint calls, source pull triggers, sequence build/storage, report generation, notifications).
- `config.json` is in `.gitignore`.
- Use `config.json.example` as the template.
- The app creates `vehicle_sequences` table in sequence DB if it does not exist.

## Tests

Unit tests cover sequence orchestration and every service class:
- `SequenceEngineTest`
- `DetectionServiceTest`
- `SequenceStorageServiceTest`
- `ReportServiceTest`
- `TelegramNotifierTest`
- `SourcePullTriggerServiceTest`

All tests are offline and use mocks (no live PostgreSQL or Telegram calls).
